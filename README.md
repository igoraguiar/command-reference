# About Command Reference

This project aggregates several tips for common tasks that can be shared with other people.

Eventually there will be someone with more expertise that can share with us how to accomplish some tasks better
and send us a pull request with the changes. That way, we aim to build a comprehensive set of common tasks with
various tools for avoiding searching the Internet whenever we need that information.

The goal is to have easy/fast access to the information about how to achieve one task completion.

You're welcome to contribute with more tips. Just fork this project and send us pull requests.

# Bugs
